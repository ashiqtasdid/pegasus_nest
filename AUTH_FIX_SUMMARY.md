# Auth Issue Fix Summary

## Problem Overview
The application is experiencing authentication issues after deployment:
1. Social authentication (GitHub) fails with the error "Social provider github is missing clientId or clientSecret"
2. The frontend is unable to connect to the API auth endpoints, resulting in 404 errors

## Root Causes

### 1. Environment Variable Interpolation
- GitHub Actions workflow was using single quotes around the heredoc delimiters (`'ENVEOF'` and `'FRONTENDEOF'`), preventing variable interpolation
- This causes OAuth credentials and other secrets to be stored as literal placeholders like `${{ secrets.OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID }}` instead of their actual values

### 2. Docker Environment Variable Passing
- Environment variables defined in the workflow file weren't being correctly passed to the Docker containers
- The frontend container wasn't receiving the required GitHub OAuth credentials

### 3. Container Networking
- Auth API endpoints might not be properly exposed or routable between containers

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow
- Removed single quotes around heredoc delimiters to enable proper variable interpolation
- Added verification steps to confirm environment variables are correctly set
- Added specific checks for GitHub OAuth credentials

### 2. Docker Configuration
- Enhanced the frontend Dockerfile to include environment variable verification
- Added a diagnostic script to verify container environment variables
- Created a script to fix GitHub OAuth configuration issues in running containers

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added verification scripts to test auth endpoints
- Created diagnostic tools to help troubleshoot auth configuration

## Files Modified
1. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Fixed environment variable interpolation
2. `frontend/Dockerfile` - Added auth environment verification
3. `verify-container-env.sh` - New script to verify container environment
4. `fix-github-oauth.sh` - New script to fix GitHub OAuth in containers
5. `diagnose-frontend-auth.ps1` - New diagnostic tool for auth configuration

## How to Verify the Fix
1. Push the changes to trigger a new GitHub Actions workflow
2. After deployment completes, run `./verify-container-env.sh` to verify environment variables
3. Test the GitHub OAuth login functionality
4. Check for proper API connectivity at `/api/auth/get-session`

## Troubleshooting
If issues persist, run the diagnostic scripts:
- `./diagnose-github-oauth.sh` - Checks GitHub OAuth configuration
- `./fix-github-oauth.sh` - Fixes OAuth environment in the container
- `./diagnose-frontend-auth.ps1` - Full frontend auth diagnostic
